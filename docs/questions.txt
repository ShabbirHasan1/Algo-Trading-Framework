1. I want to write the multithreading and multiprocessing code in flask server. On flask request, I want to use process1 as trade executer and process 2 as trade manager. Both these process should be allowed to use the threads present in them. Further the threads of processes other than these 2 should also be initiated as a strategy thread. All these threads and processes should be connected via shared memory, Can you share the logic for the same
